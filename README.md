Introducing the Inventory Manager, our newest app! This effective application is made to make keeping track of the inventory for your company or personal collection simple and straightforward. The Inventory Manager is the ideal option for anyone who needs to keep track of their inventory because it includes features like adding products, tracking stock levels, and receiving low stock notifications.
Never before has managing your inventory been so simple. With only a few touches, the Inventory Manager makes it simple to add new items to your inventory. To keep your inventory current, you may also instantly update product details like pricing, descriptions, and photographs.

My application will run on API 28 also known as Android Pie. 86.6% of cumulative usage and it is not old to be missing important features. It has enhanced performance and it includes support for the latest technologies. 

This application will require the user to allow the SMS notifications, otherwise they won’t be able to receive notification when the product’s quantity is low or reaches 0.
Later on, I will also add the functionality of taking a picture of a product and to be previewed in the application as the thumbnail of the product. This will also require the user to allow camera usage in the application. 
As the application grows, I need to employ many efficient and effective feature to keep the user liking my application and not delete it and get a different application, each feature added may require new permissions from the user and I need to work on keeping the data shared by my users safe and secure.

There are several ways to monetize this application. I can launch a limited version at first and start working on beneficial and attractive features to be added in a paid application. Then once the user pay for the pro version, I can start by offering in app purchases like new and hot features. Something I can think of as a hot feature is an inventory analysis feature, that takes all the data in the database and analyzes it and comes up with forecasts for ordering products before high seasons. Another feature that could be cool to have as an inventory manager, is billing and selling straight from the application, the feature can be used as a point of sale, that will use the camera to scan the barcode of the item and charge the customer through tap to pay or any other tool.

Thank you for reading this.
